# Spotl

Change your Spotify track via dmenu !

This project is really messy, but feel free to use any code from it.

The bash script uses walker as launcher, but it should work using rofi or any other dmenu compatible launcher.

## How to use

### Backend

You need to run `spotld` as backend.

Then, use a bash script to call `/search` then `/play`.
